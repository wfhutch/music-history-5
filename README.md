Commit on 8/23 - Added example of Promises using songs located in JSON files.  Also using a promise to console log a successful post to Firebase.  Also set up OAuth so that Firebase will not load songs until user authorization is confirmed.  Song objects in Firebase now have a uid key with a value for that particular user.

Still need to fix "All" selector in album select box so that it puts all the songs for all albums by that particular artist back on the page.  Also still need to fix delete button so that it removes song from Firebase and not just from the page.
